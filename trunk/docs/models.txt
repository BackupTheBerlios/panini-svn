just to set the ball rolling

models

1. users - extend the existing users module, need fields:
roles - many2many to roles table

2. roles - admin, translator, reviewer etc

3. projects - name, owner (fkey to users), startdate

4. files - name, version, project(fkey to project), startdate

5. translations - language, file(fkey to files) translators (m2m key to users,
reviewers, (m2m to users)

Do we save the translations as strings belonging to projects? That would
help us solve a few issues I guess. Something like --

string belongs to many files
string has one translation
string has many translation suggestion
string has zero or many comments (comments belong to files)
string has one boolean field (fuzzy)


So we can make sure each string has only one translation and many
suggestions if at all.
Kindly see how we can express the above idea in Django.
