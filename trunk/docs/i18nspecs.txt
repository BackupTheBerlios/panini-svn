Web Based Translation / Translator Management Application
---------------------------------------------------------

We are looking at building a web based translator / translation
management application. These days, i18n / l10n projects mostly get
translations done from translators by exchanging PO files via Email
which is not only slow, but also a very cumbersome process. It doesn't
allow the project admin to track changes to the PO file and also has no
scope to track contributions from a given translator. Moreover, with so
many projects to be translated and so few people participating, it's
impractical to translate most common strings automatically. There should
also be a way to remember translations so as to save time in further
translations and also assure a certain level of consistency of
translations among all applications. The major issues that are being
faced by most l10n groups today can be summarised as below --

* Lack of consistency among translations
* Lack of any translation memory
* Inefficient use of human resources
* Lack of decent machine translation facilities
* Lack of versioning information in translations
* Mostly complicated translation tools
* Desktop or web based apps are the only ways to do translation
* Lack of a coordinated effort among different teams
* There is no way to contribute in small parts
* No easy way to get the PO files as and when required
* No new contributors are coming up
* The overall process of getting something translated is too long

To solve the above problems and to make the l10n work much smoother, we
are proposing a web based application which will also act as a
centralised repository of all Indic l10n work. It will act as the
ultimate resource for all l10n volunteers. People will be able to
contribute their translations in a very easy and user friendly way. The
web based tool intends to achieve the following --

* Act as a central repository of all Indic translations across all
  products / languages.
* Make the job of the translator much easier by providing a web based
  interface.
* Make reviewing easy by clearly separating the reviewed and unreviewed
  messages [Once click access to unreviewed strings].
* Make it easy for beginners to contribute to the IndLinux project.
* Always provide up to date POT files by monitoring upstream changes.
* Make sure translations are never lost.
* Make it easy for new / small language teams to start translating.
* Provide an email interface
* Shorten the translation <-> review -> commit process

TODO: Fix the text and add some more points [must write around 1k
words]. We also need to highlight translator management features, like
how it will manage multiple teams of translators, do versioning of
translations, etc. We also need to take a look at the features of
Rosetta [http://lauchpad.net/rosetta] & Pootle
[http://pootle.wordforge.org] and see which  of the good features we need.
